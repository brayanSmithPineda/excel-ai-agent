Unit tests for DockerSandbox - Secure container execution environment

Tests cover:
1. Basic code execution (simple Python code)
2. File input/output (Excel file processing)
3. Security restrictions (network disabled, resource limits)
4. Error handling (syntax errors, runtime errors)
5. Container cleanup (no orphaned containers)
