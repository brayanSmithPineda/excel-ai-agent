---This folder is to configure our project settings, like the env variables, the supabase client --

---settings.py----
This file is to get the env variables

We use pydantic to get the variables, this class allows us to verify the type and validate the variables.
That way later we do not get into problems for setting the wrong type of config variables

--database.py--
We create the supabase clients, the clients manage the connections with the supaabse database
