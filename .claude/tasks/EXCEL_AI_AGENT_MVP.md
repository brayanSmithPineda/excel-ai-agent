### **2.1: Row Level Security (RLS) System** ✅ **FOUNDATION COMPLETE**
> 📖 **Implementation Details**: [FASTAPI_BACKEND_IMPLEMENTATION.md](FASTAPI_BACKEND_IMPLEMENTATION.md)

**Goal**: Database-level granular permissions using Supabase RLS  
**Status**: ✅ Basic RLS policies implemented - user isolation, admin override, audit integrity  
**Result**: Secure data access enforced at PostgreSQL level

### **2.2: Audit Logging System** ✅ **FOUNDATION COMPLETE**
**Goal**: Comprehensive logging infrastructure for AI interactions  
**Status**: ✅ `audit_logs` table with proper schema and RLS policies implemented  
**Result**: Ready to capture AI interactions when implemented in Task 2.3

### **2.3: Gemini AI Integration** ✅ **COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**
**Goal**: ✅ **ACHIEVED** - Integrate Google Gemini API for intelligent Excel assistance
**Result**: **PRODUCTION-READY** AI service with conversation persistence, token management, and audit logging
**Dependencies**: ✅ Authentication system, ✅ Audit logging foundation, ✅ RLS authentication resolved

**🏆 IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED**:
- ✅ **Complete GeminiService Class**: All 9 methods implemented and tested
- ✅ **Conversation Management**: Create, persist, retrieve with smart sliding window
- ✅ **Token Optimization**: Intelligent truncation staying within Gemini limits
- ✅ **Audit Logging**: Complete compliance logging for all AI interactions
- ✅ **Production Testing**: End-to-end test suite working with real authentication

### **2.4: Data Cleaning Engine**
**Goal**: Automated data cleaning algorithms for Excel data  
**Why**: Finance teams spend significant time on data preparation  
**Dependencies**: Claude AI integration for intelligent cleaning suggestions

## 🎯 PHASE 3: INTEGRATION (CURRENT FOCUS)

### **3.1: Excel Add-in Authentication Integration**
**Goal**: Connect Excel add-in frontend to our authentication system  
**Why**: Users need secure authentication before accessing AI features  
**Dependencies**: ✅ Phase 1 auth system, Phase 2 core features

### **3.2: Frontend UI Components (Task Pane & Chat Interface)**
**Goal**: React-based task pane with chat interface  
**Why**: Task panes are standard Excel add-in UI, chat provides familiar AI interaction  
**Dependencies**: Authentication integration, Claude AI endpoints

### **3.3: Data Preview System**
**Goal**: Preview data before cloud transmission  
**Why**: Security requirement - users must see what data is sent to AI  
**Dependencies**: UI components, data cleaning engine

### **3.4: Business Tool Integrations (Stripe, etc.)**
**Goal**: OAuth-based integrations with business tools  
**Why**: Provides immediate value by importing external data into Excel  
**Dependencies**: Authentication system, audit logging

## 🚀 PHASE 4: PRODUCTION (FINAL)

### **4.1: Email Confirmation Flow**
**Goal**: Re-enable email confirmation for production security  
**Why**: Production requires verified email addresses  
**Dependencies**: All core features completed

### **4.2: Testing Framework & Deployment**
**Goal**: Comprehensive testing and production deployment  
**Why**: Ensure reliability and performance for enterprise users  
**Dependencies**: All integration features completed

### **4.3: Performance Optimization**
**Goal**: Optimize for large Excel files and high user load  
**Why**: Enterprise finance teams work with large datasets  
**Dependencies**: Full system implemented and tested

### **4.4: Security Hardening & Compliance**
**Goal**: Enterprise-grade security and audit compliance  
**Why**: Finance teams require SOC 2, GDPR, and other compliance standards  
**Dependencies**: All features implemented and tested
