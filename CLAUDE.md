# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

### Before starting work
- Always in plan mode to make a plan
- After get the plan, make sure you Write the plan to .claude/tasks/TASK_NAME.md.
- The plan should be a detailed implementation plan and the reasoning behind them, as well as tasks broken down.
- If the task require external knowledge or certain package, also research to get latest knowledge (Use Task tool for research)
- Don't over plan it, always think MVP.
- Once you write the plan, firstly ask me to review it. Do not continue until I approve the plan.

### Documentation Standards Compliance

**MANDATORY: Always consult official documentation BEFORE implementing any feature**

Before building any component, feature, or integration, you MUST:

1. **Check Official Documentation First**: Always start by researching the official documentation for the specific technology/platform you're working on:

#### **Frontend/Excel Add-in (Microsoft Docs Required)**
   - **Frontend/UI**: [Office Add-ins documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/) and [Fluent UI React Components](https://react.fluentui.dev/) (Microsoft's recommended UI framework for Office applications)

   - Why you followed specific platform recommendations
   - Any deviations from official standards (with justification)

4. **Exception Process**: If you believe we should deviate from official platform recommendations:
   - **Clearly state the official recommendation we're deviating from**
   - **Provide specific technical reasons for the deviation**
   - **Document potential risks and mitigation strategies**
   - **Get explicit approval for the deviation**

**Examples of Documentation-First Approach:**
- ✅ Using Fluent UI React Components for consistent Office UI experience (Microsoft docs)
- ✅ Following Office Add-ins manifest schema and best practices (Microsoft docs)
- ✅ Implementing Supabase Row Level Security for data access control (Supabase docs)
- ✅ Using Supabase Realtime for live updates instead of custom polling (Supabase docs)
- ❌ Using a custom UI framework without checking Microsoft recommendations first
- ❌ Implementing custom authentication without consulting Supabase Auth docs

**Key Documentation Resources:**

#### **Microsoft Documentation:**

### Teaching & Learning Approach

**MANDATORY: Use guided learning approach throughout the entire project**

When working with the user, you MUST:

1. **Step-by-Step Guidance**: Break down each task into small, manageable steps
2. **Explain the "Why"**: Always explain WHY we're doing each step and WHY each dependency/approach is needed
3. **Let User Write Code**: Provide the code structure/content, but let the user implement it themselves, always check the code the user write so you make sure is correct
4. **Learning-Focused**: Ask the user to write the code following your guidance rather than using tools to write it directly
5. **Progress Tracking**: Use TodoWrite tool to track progress and keep user informed
6. **Explain Dependencies**: When adding packages, explain what each one does and why it's needed
7. **Educational Comments**: Encourage the user to add educational comments to their code

**Example Teaching Flow**:
```
✅ "Here's what we need to create and why..."
✅ "You should write this code in file X because..."
✅ "This dependency does Y and we need it for Z..."
✅ "Try this step and let me know what happens..."
❌ Direct tool usage without explanation
❌ Writing code without letting user learn
```

This ensures the user learns every concept and can maintain/extend the codebase independently.

### While implementing
- You should update the plan as you work.
- After you complete tasks in the plan, you should update and append detailed descriptions of the changes you made, so following tasks can be easily hand over to other engineers.
- Add comprehensive comments explaning every single line of code, import, and decision.
- **Always use the guided teaching approach described above**

### Documentation Navigation System

**UNIFIED FILE HIERARCHY** - All .md files use consistent PHASE.TASK numbering (1.1, 1.2, 2.1, etc.)

**📊 SESSION_STATE.md** - **PRIMARY STATUS FILE** (Single Source of Truth)
- Current session progress and what was completed today
- Immediate next 2-3 tasks with priority order
- Working commands, URLs, and development setup
- **ALWAYS check this file first** to understand current position

**🗺️ .claude/tasks/EXCEL_AI_AGENT_MVP.md** - **PROJECT ROADMAP**
- High-level project phases and milestones (Phase 1, 2, 3, 4)
- Long-term vision and success criteria
- Dependencies between tasks and phases
- Risk mitigation strategies

**🔧 .claude/tasks/FASTAPI_BACKEND_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - **BACKEND TECHNICAL GUIDE**
- Detailed technical implementation steps
- Database schema and architecture decisions
- Code examples and configuration details

**🔐 .claude/tasks/SUPABASE_AUTHENTICATION_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - **AUTH REFERENCE**
- Authentication system implementation details (now completed)
- Security patterns and best practices

**NAVIGATION RULES:**
- Each file cross-references others for easy navigation
- All files agree on current status and next tasks
- Phase.Task numbering is consistent across all files
- SESSION_STATE.md is the definitive "what's next" reference

### Session Management Workflow
**STARTING A NEW SESSION:**
1. **Read .claude/SESSION_STATE.md first** to understand current progress and immediate next tasks
2. Check referenced implementation files for technical details  
3. Use unified PHASE.TASK numbering to track progress
4. Continue where previous session left off

**ENDING A SESSION:**
1. **Update .claude/SESSION_STATE.md** with current progress
2. Update relevant implementation plans with completed tasks
3. Ensure all files remain synchronized with same task numbering
4. Note any important findings or blockers
5. Ensure all code has comprehensive comments

## Project Overview

Excel AI Agent is a Microsoft Excel add-in that serves as a secure, auditable, and governed AI copilot for Excel users, particularly targeting finance teams in mid-market companies. The project uses a hybrid architecture with a Python FastAPI backend and a TypeScript/React Excel add-in frontend.

## Architecture

The project follows a modern client-server architecture with Supabase backend:

- **Backend**: Supabase PostgreSQL database with Row Level Security (RLS), Supabase Auth for user management, and Python FastAPI application for AI integration (Anthropic Claude), data processing, and business tool integrations (Stripe, NetSuite, Notion, Metabase)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Supabase with built-in authentication, real-time subscriptions, and enterprise-grade security
- **Frontend**: TypeScript/React Excel add-in using Office.js for Excel integration, providing chat interface, task panes, and data preview modals
- **Communication**: REST API with JWT authentication between add-in and FastAPI, Supabase Realtime for live updates, WebSockets for real-time progress updates
- **Security**: Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) for granular access controls, full audit logging, data preview before cloud transmission

## Office JavaScript API Requirements

**Complete Requirement Sets Configuration:**

Our Excel AI Assistant add-in uses multiple Office JavaScript API requirement sets to enable comprehensive functionality:

### **Requirement Sets:**
- **ExcelApi 1.3** - Core Excel functionality: worksheets, ranges, tables, data manipulation
- **IdentityApi 1.3** - Authentication and identity management for JWT auth with backend  
- **DialogApi 1.2** - Dialog boxes for authentication flows and user confirmations
- **SharedRuntime 1.1** - Shared runtime for persistent state and WebSocket connections

### **Individual Methods:**
- **Office.context.document.settings.saveAsync** - Store user preferences and auth tokens
- **Office.context.document.settings.refreshAsync** - Reload stored settings
- **Office.context.ui.displayDialogAsync** - Show authentication and confirmation dialogs
- **Office.context.ui.messageParent** - Communicate between dialogs and main add-in

### **Platform Support:**
- **Office 2016+** and **Microsoft 365** (all requirement sets supported)
- **Excel on the Web** (full compatibility)
- **Excel on iPad/Mac** (varies by specific version)

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Feature Development Guidelines

**EVERY TIME you add a new Office feature to the add-in, you MUST:**

1. **Check API Compatibility**: Visit [Office JavaScript API requirement sets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/reference/requirement-sets/) to verify the minimum API version required for your new feature.

2. **Update Requirement Sets**: If your feature requires a higher API version or new requirement set, update the `<Requirements>` section in `frontend/ExcelAIAgent/manifest.xml`:
   ```xml
   <Requirements>
     <Sets DefaultMinVersion="1.1">
       <Set Name="ExcelApi" MinVersion="1.3"/>
       <Set Name="IdentityApi" MinVersion="1.3"/>
       <Set Name="DialogApi" MinVersion="1.2"/>
       <Set Name="SharedRuntime" MinVersion="1.1"/>
       <!-- Add new requirement sets here -->
     </Sets>
     <Methods>
       <!-- Add new individual methods here -->
       <Method Name="Office.context.document.settings.saveAsync"/>
     </Methods>
   </Requirements>
   ```

3. **Document the Change**: Update this section in CLAUDE.md with the new requirements and explain why they were necessary.

4. **Test Compatibility**: Ensure the add-in still works on the intended Office versions after adding new requirements.

**Current API Coverage:**
- **Excel Operations**: ExcelApi 1.3 (worksheets, ranges, tables, data manipulation)
- **Authentication**: IdentityApi 1.3 (JWT flows, token management)
- **User Interactions**: DialogApi 1.2 (auth dialogs, confirmations, data preview)
- **Persistent State**: SharedRuntime 1.1 (WebSocket connections, chat history)
- **Settings Storage**: Individual methods for preferences and tokens

**Common Additional Requirements:**
- **OpenBrowserWindowApi 1.1**: For OAuth redirects to external browser
- **RibbonApi 1.1**: For dynamic ribbon customization
- **ExcelApi 1.4+**: For advanced data analysis features
- **ExcelApi 1.7+**: For custom functions
- **ExcelApi 1.11+**: For co-authoring features

This ensures our add-in maintains compatibility while supporting the features we implement.
